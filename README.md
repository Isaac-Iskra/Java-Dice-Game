# Java-Dice-Game
A basic dice game using Java

In this game, the player has three rolls of a six-sided die to score as high as possible. The program uses a Random object to generate a random number between 1 and 6 for each roll. The scores for each roll are added together to give the player's total score at the end of the game.
